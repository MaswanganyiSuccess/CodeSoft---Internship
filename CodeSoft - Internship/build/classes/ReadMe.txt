TASK 1 : 
This Java program does the following:

Generates a random number within the specified range (1 to 100). 
Prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
Compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
Repeats steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
Limits the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
Adds the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
Displays the user's score, which is based on the number of correct guesses.

TASK 2: 
This Java program performs the following tasks:

Takes input for the number of subjects.
Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
Calculates the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects.
Calculates the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
Assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Displays the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.


TASK 3 :
In this implementation:

The BankAccount class represents the user's bank account and provides methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.
The ATM class represents the ATM machine and provides methods to interact with the user's bank account, such as checking the balance, depositing, and withdrawing money.
The Main class contains the main method to run the ATM interface. It prompts the user to choose an option (check balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit) and calls the corresponding method in the ATM class.
User input is validated to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
Appropriate messages are displayed to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.

TASK 4 :
This program allows users to perform currency conversion by selecting a base currency and a target currency.
It fetches real-time exchange rates from a reliable API, takes input for the amount to convert,
and converts the amount from the base currency to the target currency using the fetched exchange rate.
The converted amount and the target currency symbol are then displayed to the user.
